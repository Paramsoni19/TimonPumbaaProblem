# TimonPumbaaProblem
ESC 111 lab exam q2

This was the question we got in our ESC111 course final lab exam, it was pretty simple but I took much time to solve this question because of which my first question was left unattended. What I learnt is whenever you attempt big questions you should first write a pseudo code and then just follow the pseudo code, at that time you would be able to do the question faster and in effective way. 

About the problem: Timon and Pumbaa made a song, but they had less space to print it in the magazine. So timon suggested that they would retain only the letters of the song and connvert them all in the lowercase format. Pumbaa added to timon's suggestion that they would then make the letters in uppercase format which are near vowels, and then remove the vowels afterwards. now, we had to print the final song by timon and pumbaa in two seperate lines.
