ESC 111 lab exam q2

This was the question we got in our ESC111 course final lab exam, it was pretty simple but I took much time to solve this question because of which my first question was left unattended. What I learnt is whenever you attempt big questions you should first write a pseudo code and then just follow the pseudo code, at that time you would be able to do the question faster and in effective way.
